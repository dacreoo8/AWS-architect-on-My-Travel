In task 1, we designed the architecture for a website application, “MyTravel”, running 
on AWS cloud. This is our own private website page that share your travel blog. The application 
needs to meet the following requirements:

* “MyTravel” website page is public which should be accessible globally with low latency and 
high availability.

* You will regularly upload your travel pictures and words on this website. 

* All data (pictures and text) should be automatically backed up in case of disaster.

* A congratulatory email will be sent to you when the total number of website visits exceeds 
1,000,000.
